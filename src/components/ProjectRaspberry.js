    <h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
    <p>
      Check out the Raspberry Pi project, this project was a fun way to
      experiment with the Raspberry Pi and its GPIO pins, and to build a simple web interface
      to control the lights in my apartment.
    </p>
    Check out the <a href="https://github.com/esantini/eSantini" target="_blank">Front-End repo</a>
    {' '}and the <a href="https://github.com/esantini/api" target="_blank">API repo</a>.

            In this project I transformed my apartment into a tech playground.
            Hosting this very site on a Raspberry Pi, shielded by <span className="highlight">Cloudflare</span>
            {' '}and streamlined with <span className="highlight">NGINX</span>,
            I ventured into electronics by controlling lights and screens via web interfaces.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The project also included a homemade <span className="highlight">CI/CD</span> system,
            using <span className="highlight">GitHub Actions</span> and <span className="highlight">Node.js</span> to
            deploy updates through bash scriptsâ€”clunky yet effective. Plus, a live feed camera added a personal touch.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            It was a hands-on dive into web hosting, automation, and a bit of electronics, showcasing the versatility of
            software engineering beyond conventional boundaries.
